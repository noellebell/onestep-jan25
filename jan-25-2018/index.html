            <h1>Small Changes. Big Impact.</h1>
        Hello!
        <p>This site is an initiative to increase environmentally friendly lifestyles among people all over the world. Yes - that includes you. What many often do not realize is that even the smallest of choices has impact. Learn how these choices can better the world while saving you money and energy in the process.</p>
    <p>Here we encourage the attitude one step at a time. If everyone on the planet just took one step, we would live in a much healthier world. We offer information, accessibility, and comparative analysis that helps you, the user, make these choices. In the end, it is up to you. We&apos;re just here to help.</p>

            <h2>How it started</h2>

        <p>It was not until recently I came across Lauren Singer&apos;s TEDx speech that shook my world. I thought I had always lived an eco-friendly life, but when I heard her story, I realized just how much more I could do. I became conscious of everything I bought and every time I threw something away. But not everyone can live zero waste right away. That is how I came up with OneStep, a friendly guide that shows how you can gradually adapt in a way that does not disrupt your routine. In fact, youâ€™ll hardly notice (besides feeling happier).</p>

So please, join me. I promise it will be a piece of cake.
